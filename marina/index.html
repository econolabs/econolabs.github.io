        <p>Our business model is to develop, decorate, renovate homes and other buildings</p>
        <p>
            The company keeps pace with the times, builds our dynamic competitiveness, and achieves long-term
            sustainable development and prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
            We strive to actively participate in market competition and
            vigorously expand our operations through changes and resource integration.
        </p>
        <p> Our focus on customer
            satisfaction is reflected in our responsive, reliable, and efficient customer service. </p>
        <p>The company will
            firmly adhere to the concept of green development, grasp the opportunities of national policies, forge
            ahead, reform and innovate. </p>
        <p>We have a strong presence in our region</p>
        <p>
            Sanctions have significantly impacted Russia's construction sector, leading to challenges such as high
            building materials prices, disruptions in the supply chain, and a shortage of foreign materials and labor
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
            China is a great choice to get your tiles!
        </p>
        <p>Their ceramic
            industry supplies nearly half the world’s entire ceramic tile demands.</p>
        <p>
            I am planning to take through the important points of purchasing construction materials from China - what
            standards to check, where you can get them, and how to get them shipped from China to Russia.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various kinds of building materials used by our company while construction process, like steel,
            cement, concrete, ready mix concrete, binding wires, wood, stone, brick blocks, and aggregate.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are interested in wide range of products like Glazed porcelain tiles, Polished tiles, M Stone, Non
            Rectified
            tile, Ceramic wall tiles, Mosaics
            Because of the China company’s large-scale operations, they ensure a low price that can fit our budget and
            shouldn’t worry because their products are high quality and their products have a steady and stable supply
            for
            our needs.</p>
        </p>
        Ceramic tiles are a great choice of building material for our next project, but it can be hard to know what to
        look for when one want good quality and design.
        </p>
        <p>Our special goal is to examine reasonably prices and well-designed Fire Proof Carpets. We are dedicated to
            building long-term relationships with suppliers of these products based on trust, reliability, and mutual
            benefit.</p>
        <p>
            China's once-thriving housing market is in turmoil, with the crisis triggered by a liquidity crunch that
            severely impacted developers, notably the Evergrande Group.</p>
        <p> The sector's previous growth, driven by
            speculative investment and excessive borrowing, has given way to a stark reality of financial instability.
            The government's interventions, including policy adjustments and financial support, aim to stabilize the
            market and restore confidence.</p>
        <p> However, the crisis has had widespread economic effects, dampening spending
            on contruction materials in China </p>


        <p>We pay special attention to payment arrangements for imported goods.
            As the threat of secondary sanctions deters Chinese banks from facilitating trade with Russia, companies are
            flocking to the one Russian bank with a Chinese branch and facing up to six months of delays... some people
            say.
        </p>
        <p> Another person familiar with the situation once said there was a queue of two to three months for
            Chinese suppliers trying to open accounts with VTB Shanghai... "If the account is already open, then there
            are no special delays, but not all companies on the other side (foreign) are ready to work through VTB.</p>
